refactor: move RAG prompts to skills and consolidate LLM services

- RAG Architecture:
  * Migrated all hardcoded prompts from UseCases (Control, Refine, Summary, Translate) to modular Skills.
  * Introduced RefineSkill and SummarySkill for text processing logic.
  * Updated TranslationSkill and ControlSkill to return structured results and handle language contexts better.
  * Refactored UseCases to act as orchestrators using SkillContext, removing direct repository dependencies.

- Repository & Service Cleanup:
  * Deleted legacy repositories (GeminiRepository, OrionRepository, VectorRepo, Whisper repositories).
  * Consolidated LLM and Transcription logic into domain/common/services (GeminiService, OrionService, WhisperLocalService).
  * Removed circular dependencies and simplified module registrations.

- Configuration & Stability:
  * Explicitly mapped 'high' and 'low' model variants for Gemini in GeminiService.
  * Added robust fallbacks for model selection (defaulting to low if high is missing).
  * Decoupled STT model selection (GEMini_MODEL_WHISPER) from reasoning models.

- Quality Assurance:
  * Updated comprehensive unit tests for use cases and skills to match new orchestration flow.
  * Resolved build errors and improved error handling for LLM/PDF generation failures.
