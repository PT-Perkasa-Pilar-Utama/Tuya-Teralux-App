## Overview

*   **Power Input**: The main AC power source connects effectively to the Smart MCB (Tongou SY2).
*   **Protection**: The Smart MCB provides overload and short-circuit protection for the entire circuit.
*   **Distribution**: Power is distributed from the MCB to the various switches and the Zigbee Gateway (HMI).
*   **Device Control**: Smart Switches control the lighting circuits, while the Gateway manages the Zigbee network communication.

> [!CAUTION]
> **Safety Warning**: Installation should be performed by a qualified electrician using standard safety procedures. Ensure the main power is turned OFF before performing any wiring connections.
